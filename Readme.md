# WinForms Data Grid - Add custom data rows

This example demonstrates how to display custom rows (ordinal, blank/group, and summary) in the WinForms Data Grid. Custom rows do not exist in the grid's data source. Custom rows support data editing, sorting, and grouping.

The example creates a data source wrapper and handles the following events:

* The [CustomColumnSort](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.ColumnView.CustomColumnSort) event is handled to display custom rows at the specified position regardless of sorting.
* The [ShowingEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.ColumnView.ShowingEditor) event is handled to prevent editing blank and summary custom rows.
* The [CustomColumnGroup](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView.CustomColumnGroup) event is handled to group custom rows. The [CustomDrawGroupRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView.CustomDrawGroupRow) event is handled to display text within a custom group row.
